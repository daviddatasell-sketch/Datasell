## 🚀 Your Real 3-Step Action Plan

### STEP 1: Google Search Console (MOST IMPORTANT)
```
https://search.google.com/search-console
```
- Add property: https://www.datasell.store
- Verify ownership
- Submit sitemap
- Monitor "Performance" tab daily
- Fix any 404 errors immediately

**Why:** This is where you see:
- How many times Google shows your site
- How many people click to visit
- What keywords you're ranking for
- What errors Google found

### STEP 2: Fix Technical Issues
```bash
node seo-tools/sitemap-generator.js
```
This creates:
- `sitemap.xml` - Tells Google all your pages
- `robots.txt` - Crawling instructions

Then:
- Add meta tags to your pages (templates provided)
- Add JSON-LD structured data
- Optimize images (WebP format)
- Improve page speed (goal: <3 seconds)

### STEP 3: Build Backlinks & Content
```bash
node seo-tools/backlink-manager.js
```
- Submit to 10 Ghana directories
- Write blog posts (1 per week)
- Guest posts on tech blogs
- This increases your "authority" so Google ranks you higher
